# Scheduling-Algorithms

Program: CPUSchedulingAlgorithms.cpp

step 1: We will connect to CSE server to execute the designed cpp code
step 2: By using vi a new file is created
Step 3: In the code we have created functions seperately for algorithms to run.
	   we used to the case statement to select the type of algorithm we are ready to run
step 4: The code is saved and we will exit by :wq!
Step 5: The file is moved to compliation by ./CPUSchedulingAlgorithms
step 6: The created exectuable file is complied by gcc -o CPUSchedulingAlgorithms CPUSchedulingAlgorithms.cpp
Step 7: No of frames is given as input
Step 5: The output will be displayed.
