# Scheduling-Algorithms

Program: CPUSchedulingAlgorithms.cpp

step 1: We will connect to CSE server to execute the designed cpp code

step 2: By using vi a new file is created

Step 3: In the code we have created functions seperately for algorithms to run.
	   we used to the case statement to select the type of algorithm we are ready to run
	   
step 4: The code is saved and we will exit by :wq!

Step 5: The file is moved to compliation by ./CPUSchedulingAlgorithms

step 6: The created exectuable file is complied by gcc -o CPUSchedulingAlgorithms CPUSchedulingAlgorithms.cpp

Step 7: No of frames is given as input

Step 5: The output will be displayed.
